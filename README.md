searches for keywords within a resume...


Write a resume scanning simulator.  You are to write a program that will read in 
a resume (you can assume that the document is located with the source file and it is 
named resume.txt (make this up).

Your program will read in a text file that contains KEYWORDS from zero to 50 keywords (make this up). 
in the file will be separated by commas.  No keyword will contain a comma.  You are to count
the total times the keywords are found in the fake resume.  Your program will simply output
to the screen the count of keywords with in the document.  In real life the higher the number
the higher the chance that the person (the owner of the resume) will get an interview.
